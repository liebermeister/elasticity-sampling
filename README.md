Elasticity Sampling functions for Matlab
========================================

Wolfram Liebermeister (2016)

## Dependencies: 

The functions for elasticity sampling depend on the Metabolic Network Toolbox (https://github.com/liebermeister/metabolic-network-toolbox). Some functions depend on the following Matlab toolboxes:

  o SBML Toolbox               (http://sbml.org/Software/SBMLToolbox)

  o SBtab functions            (https://github.com/liebermeister/sbtab-matlab)

  o Tensor Toolbox             (http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html)

  o efmtool                    (http://www.csb.ethz.ch/tools/efmtool)

Please make sure that these matlab packages are installed in your system and that all these directories and subdirectories are included in your matlab path.

If CPLEX for matlab is installed in your system, this will speed up some calculations,

For getting started, please see the instructions at
