Example matlab scripts for elasticity sampling
----------------------------------------------

This directory contains three kinds of example m-files:

o The interactive demo script, "demo_e_coli_glycolysis.m", can be directly run 
  in matlab and shows how elasticity sampling with a simple model can be performed
  by running a series of commands.

o The demo script "elasticity_sampling_workflow" shows possible variations of this
  workflow. It can also be run in matlab, but it contains many possible alternatives
  that are commented out. To apply elasticity sampling to one of your models, you may
  start from this script and modify it to adapt it to your needs.

o The directory 'article_figures' contains matlab scripts that were use to generate the
  figures in the elasticity sampling article. 

All scripts use data from the 'resources' directory in the main directory.
General numerical data are given in the subdirectory "data", 
model-specific data are given in the subdirectories "models" and "models-article".
