-----------------------------------------------------
Example models shown in the article 
"Elasticity sampling links thermodynamic forces to metabolic control, synergies, and fluctuations"
-----------------------------------------------------

All models were created in MATLAB using the Metabolic Network Toolbox
and the functions for Elasticity Sampling accompanying the article.

MATLAB functions can be freely downloaded from GITHUB:
https://github.com/wolframliebermeister/elasticity_sampling

All models are provided in two formats, as SBML and MATLAB .mat files.
Files "..reference_state" contain the results of elasticity sampling.
