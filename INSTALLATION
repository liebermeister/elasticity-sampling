Elasticity Sampling Toolbox for Matlab

Wolfram Liebermeister (2014)
---------------------------------------------------------------------


INSTALLATION

  1. Unpack the files
  2. Include the subdirectory 'elasticity_sampling' into your Matlab path
  3. Make sure that the following toolboxes are installed:
      o Metabolic Network Toolbox (https://github.com/liebermeister/mnt)
      o SBML Toolbox    (http://sbml.org/Software/SBMLToolbox)
      o SBtab           (https://github.com/liebermeister/sbtab-matlab)
      o Tensor Toolbox  (http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html)
      o efmtool         (http://www.csb.ethz.ch/tools/efmtool)
  4. For a little demo, run 'es_demo'


REQUIREMENTS

  The functions have been developed and tested with matlab6 
    
  They require 
    Metabolic Network Toolbox (https://github.com/liebermeister/mnt)
    SBMLtoolbox    - SBML import / export  (see http://sbml.org/Software/SBMLToolbox)
    SBtab toolbox  - SBtab format (https://github.com/liebermeister/sbtab-matlab)
    Tensor toolbox - Tensors (http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html)
    efmtool        - Elementary flux modes (see http://www.csb.ethz.ch/tools/efmtool)
 
  If CPLEX for matlab is installed in your system, this will speed up some calculations,

STATE OF THE SOFTWARE.

  The functions are under development and provided 'as is'.
  If you would like to contribute extensions to the toolbox, please let me know.
