Elasticity Sampling Toolbox for Matlab

Wolfram Liebermeister (2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------


INSTALLATION

  1. Unpack the files
  2. Include the subdirectory 'elasticity_sampling' into your Matlab path
  3. Make sure that the following toolboxes are installed:
      o Metabolic Network Toolbox (https://github.com/wolframliebermeister/mnt)
      o SBML Toolbox              (http://sbml.org/Software/SBMLToolbox)
      o Tensor Toolbox            (http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html)
  4. For a little demo, run 'es_demo'


REQUIREMENTS

  The functions were developed and tested with matlab6 and require 
  the Metabolic Network Toolbox (which requires the SBML Toolbox and efmtool) and
  the Tensor toolbox (see http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html)


STATE OF THE SOFTWARE.

  The functions are under development and provided 'as is'.
  If you would like to contribute extensions to the toolbox, please let me know.
